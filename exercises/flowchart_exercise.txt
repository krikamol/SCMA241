Draw a flowchart for each of the following programs.

- a program that gets radius of a circle and calculate the area and 
  the perimeter of the circle.

- a program that gets width and height of the rectangle and calculate 
  the area and the perimeter of the rectangle.

- a program that gets an integer as an input and print the following 
  message:
  1) print "DIVISIBLE BY 3" if the number is divisible by 3
  2) print "DIVISIBLE BY 5" if the number is divisible by 5
  3) print "DIVISIBLE BY 3 and 5" if the number if divisible by both 3 and 5

- a program that gets the score and determines the grade of the student. 
  The program should print the following message:
  1) print "Grade A" if 80 < score <= 100
  2) print "Grade B" if 70 < score <= 80
  3) print "Grade C" if 60 < score <= 70
  4) print "Grade D" if 50 < score <= 60
  5) print "Grade F" if score <= 50

- a program that gets two input integers, x and y,
  where x < y, and prints all the integers between 
  x and y.

- a program that gets two input integers, x and y, and check if x is divisible
  by y. The program can, for example, print the following messages:
  1) x is divisible by y (for example if x=6 and y=3)
  2) x is not divisible by y (for example if x=6 and y=4)

- a program that gets an input integer and check if it is the prime number.

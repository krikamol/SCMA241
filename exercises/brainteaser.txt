- Given an even number that is greater than 2, write a program that returns two prime numbers whose sum will 
be equal to given number (see Goldbach's conjecture).  

Example: 4 = 2 + 2

- Given a positive integer, write a program that finds if it can be expressed as A^B where A > 1 and B > 0 where A and B both should be integers.

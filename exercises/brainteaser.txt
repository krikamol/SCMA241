- Given an even number that is greater than 2, write a program that returns two prime numbers whose sum will 
be equal to given number (see Goldbach's conjecture).  

Example: 4 = 2 + 2

- Given a positive integer, write a program that finds if it can be expressed as A^B where A > 1 and B > 0 where A and B both should be integers.

- Given 2 non-negative integers m and n, find gcd(m, n). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both m and n.

- Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

  Example :

    Input : [1 2 2 3 3 4 1]
    Output : 4

- Write a program that converts a column title as appears in an Excel sheet (e.g., A,B,...Z,AA,AB,...) to its corresponding column number (e.g., 1,2,...26,27,28,...).
